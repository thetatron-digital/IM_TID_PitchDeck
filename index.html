  <div class="pq-t">If you told most people "this is a documentary about a Twitch streamer," they'd check out. So Act I has to immediately bypass that assumption by grounding us in a universal human story: a girl who lost everything, whose parents gave up on her, who couldn't walk or speak or leave her bed, and who somehow refused to accept that as the end.</div>

  <div class="stt rv d1">
    <p>What drew me in was not the technology or the fame. It was a girl in a bed who decided she was not done yet.</p>
    <p>This is not a film about VTubing. It is a film about what happens when you build a life inside a machine and then have to figure out how to be a person again. It is about a mother who prays in a hallway because she thinks God is punishing her. It is about a doorbell that means more than any concert.</p>
    <p>I want to make the film that treats this community with the same cinematic seriousness we give to any other subject. No condescension. No novelty. Just a real story about a real person who happens to be invisible.</p>
